# About ghostAudio

**ghostAudio** was created as an independent initiative focused on developing **accessible synthesis and sound-processing tools** inspired by modern sound design and *minimal aesthetics*.

The project was born in an *academic context* at **Audioplace Academy**, which led to the development of the **Wavemaker** module for VCV Rack 2, with the goal of *expanding the open-source modular ecosystem* and *encouraging learning in audio software development*.
